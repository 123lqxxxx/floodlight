What is Floodlight?
-------------------

Floodlight is the leading open source OpenFlow controller. It is [supported by a community of developers](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/display/floodlightcontroller/Authors+and+Contributors), including a number of engineers from [Big Switch Networks](http://www.bigswitch.com/).

What is OpenFlow?
-----------------

OpenFlow is a open standard managed by Open Networking Foundation. It specifies a protocol by which a remote controller can modify the behavior of networking devices through a well-defined “forwarding instruction set”. Floodlight is designed to work with the growing number of switches, routers, virtual switches, and access points that support the OpenFlow standard.
